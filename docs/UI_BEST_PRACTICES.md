# UI Best Practices

These guidelines help keep the interface clean and user friendly.

- Use insight cards to surface missing data percentage and outlier counts so users notice data quality issues immediately.
- Offer an "Explain this chart" action so less technical users can understand plots.
- Keep prompts and buttons short; avoid overwhelming the user with options.
- Persist theme choice and chart presets in local storage for convenience.
- Show analysis results and chart explanations near the relevant plot for context.
